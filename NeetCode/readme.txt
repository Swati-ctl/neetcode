Solved 
You are given an integer array nums of length n. Create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays.

Return the array ans.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,1,2]

Output: [1,4,1,2,1,4,1,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [22,21,20,1]

Output: [22,21,20,1,22,21,20,1]
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000.
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

Prize pool over $1M.
